Imagine looking for the essence of a river—you might point to the water, the banks, or the current, but where exactly is "the river"? This beautiful puzzle captures what Buddhism calls *anatta*, a Pali word meaning "no-self" or "not-self." It's the radical yet liberating insight that despite our strong sense of being a solid, unchanging "me," there's actually no permanent, fixed self to be found anywhere within us.

Think of yourself as like that river. The Buddha taught that what we call "self" is really five flowing processes working together: our physical body, feelings of pleasant or unpleasant, perceptions that recognize things, mental formations like thoughts and emotions, and consciousness that's aware of it all. These five aggregates are constantly changing, like water flowing in a riverbed. Yesterday's thoughts, today's body, tomorrow's feelings—all different, all flowing.

This isn't meant to frighten us, dear friend, but to free us! When we truly see there's no solid self to protect or inflate, the desperate grasping that causes our suffering begins to relax. We stop taking everything so personally. The harsh inner critic loses its target. We discover a spacious peace that was always there, hidden beneath our tight grip on a "self" that was never really solid to begin with.
