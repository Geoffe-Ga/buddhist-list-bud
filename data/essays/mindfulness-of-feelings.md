Mindfulness of feelings is like becoming a gentle observer of your emotional weather patterns. In Pali, this practice is called *vedanānupassanā*, which literally means "watching over feelings" or "contemplating feelings." Here, "feelings" doesn't refer to complex emotions like jealousy or excitement, but rather the basic tone of pleasantness, unpleasantness, or neutrality that colors every moment of experience.

Imagine you're drinking your morning coffee. As you take that first sip, there's an immediate pleasant feeling-tone that arises—not the thought "this coffee is delicious," but the raw, wordless sense of pleasantness itself. Or when you hear your neighbor's leaf blower at dawn, notice the immediate unpleasant feeling-tone before your mind creates stories about inconsiderate neighbors. Much of the time, our experiences carry a neutral feeling-tone, like the sensation of your clothes touching your skin right now.

This practice matters deeply because these basic feeling-tones are like invisible puppet strings controlling our reactions. Pleasant feelings typically trigger craving and clinging, while unpleasant ones spark aversion and pushing away. By learning to observe these subtle feeling-tones with gentle awareness, we begin to see how they automatically condition our responses. This understanding gradually loosens their grip on us, creating space for wisdom and genuine freedom to emerge naturally.
