Imagine walking through life wearing sunglasses that distort everything you see, making you constantly misunderstand what's really happening around you. This is essentially what the Buddha meant by delusion or ignorance, which in Pali is called *moha* when referring to confusion and bewilderment, or *avijja* meaning literally "not knowing" or "without wisdom."

This isn't about lacking book knowledge or being unintelligent. Rather, it's about not seeing the true nature of reality—particularly how everything is impermanent, interconnected, and not quite what we imagine it to be. For example, we might cling desperately to a relationship, believing it will last forever and bring us lasting happiness, when in reality all relationships naturally change and evolve. Our delusion makes us suffer when these inevitable changes occur.

Think of delusion as the root cause that feeds our other mental difficulties. When we don't see clearly, we develop unhealthy attachments and react with anger or fear to situations that might not even be real threats. It's like being afraid of a rope because we mistook it for a snake in dim light.

Understanding this concept matters deeply because recognizing our delusion is the first step toward freedom. Once we begin to see how our misperceptions create suffering, we can start cultivating wisdom and clarity—the very foundation of the path to awakening.
