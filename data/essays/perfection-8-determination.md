Imagine you're learning to play piano. At first, your fingers fumble over the keys, and you feel frustrated. But something inside you says, "I won't give up." That inner resolve is what Buddhists call *adhitthana*, meaning "firm determination" or "unwavering resolve."

The Pali word *adhitthana* comes from roots meaning "to stand firm upon" or "to establish oneself steadily." It's like planting your feet solidly on the ground before lifting something heavy – you need that stable foundation of inner resolve.

Think of a river flowing toward the ocean. Sometimes it encounters rocks, fallen trees, or steep banks, but it doesn't stop – it finds a way around, over, or through every obstacle. This is the quality of *adhitthana* in spiritual practice. When meditation feels difficult, when old habits pull you backward, or when progress seems slow, determination keeps you moving forward on the path.

This isn't about gritting your teeth or forcing yourself through sheer willpower. True *adhitthana* is more like a gentle but unshakeable commitment – the kind a loving parent has toward their child's wellbeing. It's patient, persistent, and comes from understanding why this journey toward freedom from suffering matters so deeply.

Without determination, even the most profound teachings remain just beautiful ideas. With it, every small step becomes part of your awakening.
