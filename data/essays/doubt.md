Doubt in Buddhism refers to that restless uncertainty that keeps our minds spinning in circles, questioning everything without finding resolution. In Pali, this is called "vicikicchā" (pronounced "vee-chee-kee-cha"), which literally means "thinking in various ways" or "wavering thought." It's that mental state where we can't settle on anything because we're constantly second-guessing ourselves.

Imagine you're at a restaurant staring at the menu, unable to decide what to order. You consider the pasta, then worry it might be too heavy. The salad looks good, but maybe it won't be filling enough. The fish sounds appealing, but what if it's overcooked? Your mind keeps jumping from option to option, never settling, and meanwhile you're getting hungrier and more frustrated. This is exactly how doubt operates in our spiritual life.

When doubt arises during meditation or study, we might think, "Is this practice really working? Am I doing it right? Maybe I should try a different technique." This constant questioning prevents us from going deeper into any one practice or understanding. The Buddha identified doubt as one of the five hindrances because it blocks our ability to develop the concentrated, clear awareness needed for wisdom to arise. The antidote isn't blind faith, but rather patient investigation and gentle persistence, allowing understanding to unfold naturally through consistent practice.
